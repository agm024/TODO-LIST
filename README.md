**Project Title: "TO-DO LIST"**

In the bustling digital age, managing our daily tasks efficiently is crucial. Enter **TO-DO LIST**, a web-based task management application designed to simplify your life. Let's delve into the details of this project:

## **Features:**
1. **Task Creation and Deletion**:
   - Users can effortlessly create tasks for themselves. Whether it's a work deadline, a grocery list, or a personal goal, TO-DO LIST has you covered.
   - Deleting completed or unnecessary tasks is just a click away.

2. **Universal Accessibility**:
   - The true beauty of TO-DO LIST lies in its accessibility. You can access your tasks from anywhere‚Äîwhether you're sipping coffee at a caf√©, commuting on a train, or relaxing at home.
   - It's compatible with all devices‚Äîdesktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

3. **Secure Data Storage**:
   - Worried about losing your tasks? Fear not! TO-DO LIST securely stores all your data.
   - No one can peek into your tasks without your login credentials.

## **Tech Stack:**
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions and client-side functionality.
- **SQL**: To manage the database (in our case, the `tasks.db`).
- **HTML/CSS**: Crafting the user interface and styling.
- **Python Flask**: The backbone of our server-side logic.

## **My Journey:**
- I embarked on this project solo, fueled by curiosity and a desire to create something practical.
- Inside `app.py`, I linked the program to the `tasks.db` database. This file handles login, registration, and the main page routes.
   - **Login**: Allows users to log in using their credentials.
   - **Register**: Creates new login IDs and passwords.
   - **Main Page**: Here, users can insert and delete tasks. Oh, and don't forget the logout route!

- Inside `tasks.db`, we store user data and track registered users.
- `index.html` (the main page) features a table where tasks are displayed. Users can add or delete tasks seamlessly.
- `login.html` and `register.html` handle user authentication with clean interfaces.
- `style.css` adds the finishing touch, making our website visually appealing.

## **Conclusion:**
TO-DO LIST was more than just lines of code; it was an intriguing journey. As I coded, I imagined users ticking off tasks, achieving goals, and feeling a sense of accomplishment. So, here's to TO-DO LIST‚Äîa digital companion that keeps your life organized, one task at a time! üìù‚ú®
